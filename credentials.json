                "explanation": "A stock dividend is a type of dividend that is paid out to shareholders in the form of additional shares of stock, rather than cash. When a company issues a stock dividend, existing shareholders receive more shares based on the number of shares they already own. This can result in an increase in the total number of shares held by investors without any actual cash being distributed. Stock dividends are often used by companies to conserve cash while still rewarding shareholders."
